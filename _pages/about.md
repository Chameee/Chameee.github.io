I am currently a junior year student at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn), [School of Data Science](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn), major in Data Science. 

My research interests are in Artificial Intelligence, Statistics Theory used in Machine Learning. 

Besides, as a member of [FDUCSLG](https://github.com/FDUCSLG) ( an open community for technology enthusiasts in Fudan ), I am a backend developer in Project [fudan_today](https://fdxk.info) ( an open, cross-platform commmunity for all students to get information conveniently and share opinions freely ).

During the past two semesters, I worked as a Program Director in [TECC_FDU](), which is one of the largest student-based volunteer organizations in Fudan
